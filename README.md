# Star-alternating-blinking-LEDs-PCB

Thank you JLCPCB for sponsoring me this project.

The star PCB uses transistors and capacitors to create 2 sets of alternating square waveforms which light the LEDs.

Frequency, f = 1 / (0.68 * 2 * R * C)

We are using 7.5K ohm resistors and 100uF capacitors, which gives us about 1 Hz frequency. The cycle is about 1 second.

The 1K ohm resistor is used to limit the current to avoid overheating of the circuit.

I would like to thank JLCPCB again for sponsoring the PCB and please buy your PCB at jlcpcb.com/RAT
